## exp-00 — StateTree hello world

- **Started:** 2026-09-17
- **Stack:** Python 3.13 + pygame, managed with uv
- **Run:** `cd experiments/exp-00 && uv run src/main.py`
- **Test:** `cd experiments/exp-00 && uv run pytest`
- **Design:** [`exp-00/docs/specs/2026-09-17-exp-00-statetree-visualizer-design.md`](exp-00/docs/specs/2026-09-17-exp-00-statetree-visualizer-design.md)

### Why

A quick mockup, built outside Unreal Engine because UE5 is a very large download.
It's a hello world of pathing and object use that shows what the AI systems will
be like once there's UE to write AI for.

### What

An isometric pygame window showing a hexagon-shaped hex-tile world (25 tiles
across, with a camera that follows the actor) with three placeholder
objects (A, B, C) and a single actor. The objects are modeled on UE5's **Smart
Objects**: Sims-style interactables that advertise interactions and offer slots
the actor claims, walks to, uses, and releases. The actor's behavior is driven by a
small **StateTree-style** engine modeled on UE5's StateTree: hierarchical states,
enter conditions, tasks, transitions, and evaluators writing to a shared context.
The actor paths to object slots with **A\*** on the hex grid.

Which object the actor goes to next depends on **where it is** (West or East zone)
and **which object it used last**. These rules are placeholders, kept in one data
file (`src/ai/tree_def.py`) so they're easy to change.

A side panel shows what's going on in the actor's "brain" while the sim runs: the
state tree with the active branch highlighted and pass/fail marks on each enter
condition, the current context values, and a running transition log.

### Layout

- `src/` — game loop, hex grid, world model, Smart Objects, camera, rendering, starting layout (`layout.py`), sim wiring (`sim.py`)
- `src/ai/` — StateTree engine, tasks/evaluators, the example tree, A* pathing
- `tests/` — pytest for the hex grid, world zones, pathing, Smart Objects, the StateTree engine, the tasks, the starting layout, the tree definition, the sim cycle, and the headless main loop

### Controls

Space pause/resume · N step one tick while paused · +/- sim speed (0.25x-8x) · R reset · Esc quit.

### Headless

`cd experiments/exp-00 && SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy SDL_AUDIODRIVER=dummy uv run src/main.py --frames N --speed S --screenshot-dir screenshots --screenshot-every K` (screenshots/ is gitignored).

## exp-01 — Wandering Smart Objects

- **Started:** 2026-09-17
- **Stack:** Python 3.13 + pygame, managed with uv
- **Run:** `cd experiments/exp-01 && uv run src/main.py`
- **Test:** `cd experiments/exp-01 && uv run pytest`
- **Design:** [`exp-01/docs/specs/2026-09-17-exp-01-wandering-objects-design.md`](exp-01/docs/specs/2026-09-17-exp-01-wandering-objects-design.md)

### Why

Built on exp-00. It's almost the same, but the targets slowly wander around.

### What

Starts as a copy of exp-00: same hex map, camera, StateTree engine, Smart Objects, A\* pathing and brain panel.

**What changes:**
- **Three zones.** The map is split into three 120° sectors (NE, S, NW).
- **Wandering objects.** Each Smart Object wanders inside its own zone, with stochastic momentum. It usually keeps its heading, and sharper turns are less likely. Slots ride along with their object and can poke across a zone border.
- **Chasing.** The actor re-plans when its claimed slot moves or its path gets blocked.
- **Pausing.** A and B hold still while in use. C keeps moving, and the interaction fails if its slot drifts away.
- **Rules.** The placeholder rules still key on the last object used and the actor's zone. Finishing in that object's home zone moves forward (A→B→C), and finishing across a border moves backward.

### Layout

- `src/`: same as exp-00, plus `wander.py`, the stochastic object mover.
- `src/ai/`: same as exp-00. `tasks.py` gains chasing, re-planning and in-use tracking.
- `tests/`: same as exp-00, plus `test_wander.py`. The sim tests check invariants over seeded runs instead of a fixed cycle: claims, in-use, zones, overlaps and step order.

### Open questions

Three design and tuning questions from the final review are listed in the spec's "Open questions" section: the slot marker during a mid-step pause, claims abandoned on brief blocks and C's drift-failure rate, and wall placement.

### Controls

Same as exp-00: Space pause/resume · N step one tick while paused · +/- sim speed (0.25x-8x) · R reset · Esc quit.

### Headless

`cd experiments/exp-01 && SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy SDL_AUDIODRIVER=dummy uv run src/main.py --frames N --speed S --screenshot-dir screenshots --screenshot-every K` (screenshots/ is gitignored).
